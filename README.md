# Wealthy Pockets®
This is the first Solo Project for CodeClan, Cohort3.  
The purpose of this project is to consolidate what we've been learning during our first month and possibly expanding it with further features.  
Finally, we will present our final product explaining our code what we've learned in the process, our obstacles, etc.  
We have to choose [_**one**_ among the following ideas](https://github.com/FrancescoPalma/CodeClan_Assignment_1/blob/master/projects.md) and build a web application according to the specs of the related project.  
I have chosen the **second project** (i.e. MoneyCashBoard) for I have a real interest in applying technology to finance, especially financial inclusion and financial education. Therefore, I want to start practicing on building apps on this topic.  

**Time:** From Thursday 11/03/16 to Thursday 18/03/16  
**Concepts to be applied:** Ruby, TDD, OOP, Web Programming(MVC, REST), Relational Databases with CRUD actions  
  
**Requirements for MVP:**  
- Create new transactions  
- Display all transactions  
- Display total expenditure  
- Display total expenditure by tag  
  
**Potential Further functionalities to build:**  
- CRUD actions for the transactions  
- Create a route that sends down Account data as JSON  
  
## My App Journal | Your App Guide  
I am a Software Developer in training and this is my very first solo project at CodeClan.  
Therefore, I've decided to post here a daily journal with the purpose to give the reader of this repository a complete comprehension of how this project is being built from scratch, from planning to deployment.  
For such reasons, this is a journal to me but an optional further guide to you as a reader.

#### Day 1  
Today I've been working on the planning of the app writing notes and using the white board.  
i found really beneficial to share thoughts with other coworkers who are going to build the same app.  
We worked on the MVC model, we designed the database and we came up with a potential final interface.  
Even if we are all going to build our own project with our own structure and style I think it's important to share first some ideas and collaborate before tackling the project.  
  
#### Day 2  
Today I didn't have enough time to start coding for I participated in an amazing series of talks about Webpack and Xamarin.iOS. Therefore, I've decided to draw a final design plan for the app.  
Tomorrow I'm going to start coding to focus my efforts on the back-end side of the project.  
  
#### Day 3  
Today I've spent most of the day working on the back-end. The tests pass, I've created the database and its tables, I've set up the skeleton of the app by organising folders and files and I've inserted the seed data.  
I've decided to try building a further functionality: **Income**.  
I want my app to display the running total of the expenses as well as the income (per month) in order to calculate a final balance. So far no real obstacles even though I am still in the process of trying to keep my focus on a 'step by step' aproach without falling into the trap of 'overthinking' or 'overengineering'.  
One functionality at a time, it's my current motto.  
A lesson I learnt today is that planning is important - planning _well_ is actually **fundamental** - and I like it even though at the end it's even more important to start coding, see the outcome and making the appropriate changes accordingly.
